## Late Submission

Late submission will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and only granted under extreme circumstances.

## Religious Holidays

Because of the extraordinary variety of religious affiliations of the University student body and staff, the Academic Calendar makes no provisions for religious holidays. However, it is University policy to respect the faith and religious obligations of the individual. Students with classes or examinations that conflict with their religious observances are expected to notify their instructors well in advance so that mutually agreeable alternatives may be worked out.

## Student Disability Services

If you have a documented disability that requires accommodations, you will need to register with Student Disability Services for coordination of your academic accommodations. Once your accommodation is in place, someone can meet with you privately to discuss your special needs. Student Disability Services' mission is to assist the university in creating an accessible community where students with disabilities have an equal opportunity to fully participate in their educational experience.
Students who are registered with Student Disability Services and who are eligible for alternate testing accommodations such as extended test time and/or a distraction-reduced environment should present the required test permit to the professor at least one week in advance of the exam. Federal law requires that a student registered with SDS is entitled to the reasonable accommodations specified in the studentâ€™s accommodation letter, which might include allowing the student to take the final exam on a day different than the rest of the class.

## Course Drops and Withdrawals

In the first two weeks of the (full) term, students can drop this class and receive 100% tuition and course fee cancellation. After the end of the second week there is no tuition or fee cancellation. Students who wish to withdraw from the class can initiate a withdrawal request on Pipeline. You will receive a transcript notation of WP (passing), WF (failing), or WN (no graded work) at the time of withdrawal. No withdrawals can be initiated after the end of the tenth week. Students enrolled in the 10th week and beyond will receive a grade. Because withdrawing from courses may have negative academic and financial consequences, students considering course withdrawal should make sure they fully understand all the consequences before taking this step.

## Class Recordings

All virtual classes will be recorded for the benefit of students that are unable to attend. They will not be shared outside of our class. Students need prior written permission from the instructor before recording any portion of this class.
