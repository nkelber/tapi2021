# About
Welcome to *Teaching Text Analysis with Constellate*, a course for Constellate Beta participants.   The site has three main purposes:

1. To help train teachers in text analysis
2. To share computational text analysis lessons in an Open Educational Directory
3. To serve as a template for your own teacher workshops and courses

If you are completely new to teaching text analysis, we recommend you join our free one-month courses taught by Dr. Nathan Kelber of JSTOR Labs. Find out more by [joining our email list](mailto:tdm@ithaka.org?Subject=Joining%20Constellate%20Community).
