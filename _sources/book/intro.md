# About
Welcome to the **2021 Text Analysis Pedagogy Institute**, an open educational institute for the benefit of teachers (and aspiring teachers) of text analysis in the digital humanities and data science. The 2021 TAP Institute is led by [JSTOR Labs](https://labs.jstor.org) in partnership with [The University of Virginia Library](https://www.library.virginia.edu/) and [The University of Virginia School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/). It is made possible by funding from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://neh.gov).

This site contains links to the workshops for the institute and intends to:

1. Help train teachers in text analysis
2. Share computational text analysis lessons in an Open Educational Directory
3. Serve as a template for your own teacher workshops and courses
