# Why should digital humanists learn text analysis? 

You may have heard buzz on campus about text analysis, artificial intelligence, or big data. But if you're a scholar, librarian, student, or staff member who has never used data in their research, it is not obvious why text analysis matters. Many disciplines have eschewed text analysis for decades (and we all know a few faculty members likely to continue for decades more), but there is no doubt that interest in the field is growing. Why should you learn text analysis when you could be doing traditional research right now?

## The Future of Humanities Research Depends on Data Literacy

Twenty years ago, working with data was mostly reserved for the sciences and social sciences, but today it is clear that digital data has become the primary publishing and archival format for humankind. The ability to search and manipulate that record is what will allow future researchers to find important information. Historians of the future looking at our present moment will need to be able to analyze emails, text messages, websites, social media, and other digital files. How well can we really understand history and society if we are not prepared to search, read, and interpret digital records in the form of primary sources?

## Data Skills are in Demand

In a world where tenure-track positions in the humanities are the exception rather than the norm, humanities scholars need a flexible skillset that prepares them for working inside and outside the academy. Text analysis is a valuable skill. (There is a reason that Data Scientist has been chosen as the best job according to Glassdoor in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.)

Text analysis is behind the auto-suggest on your phone; it filters the spam out of your email; and it helps suggest movies for you on Netflix. In this information age, with the onset of "big data," text analysis helps us "read" and "interpret" more than is humanly possible. Text analysis skills are valuable in the academic world and the commercial sector.
 
## The Algorithmic Bias of Data-Driven Decision-Making is a Humanities Problem

Even if you don't use text analysis for your own research, it is important to understand a little about how it works because text analysis already drives the way decisions are made in research, in business, and in government. Text analysis and machine algorithms are deciding what webpages you see, who gets a loan from the bank, and how politicians make policy decisions. The issues surrounding text analysis are humanist issues, not merely technical, but social, ethical, and legal.

> Decisions of civic, economic, and individual importance are already and increasingly being made by automated systems sifting through large amounts of data. For example, PredPol, a so-called predictive policing company founded in 2012 by an anthropology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, has been employed by the City of Los Angeles for nearly a decade to determine which neighborhoods to patrol more heavily, and which neighborhoods to (mostly) ignore. But because PredPol is based on historical crime data and US policing practices have always disproportionately surveilled and patrolled neighborhoods of color, the predictions of where crime will happen in the future look a lot like the racist practices of the past.

Cutting edge public and digital humanities work increasingly engages with algorithmic bias:

> The same sort of algorithmic filtering that uses more ethnically tailored representations into my feed can also redirect real estate ads away from people “like me.” This filtering has been used to show higher-paying job ads to men more often than to women, to charge more for standardized test prep courses to people in areas with a high density of Asian residents, and many other forms of coded inequity.

>...the difference is that coded inequity makes discrimination easier, faster, and even harder to challenge, because there is not just a racist boss, banker, or shopkeeper to report. Instead, the public must hold accountable the very platforms and programmers that legally and often invisibly facilitate the New Jim Code... (33)

## Text analysis enables new research insights

For researchers, the primary advantage that text and data mining offer is an ability to consider knowledge at non-human scales (both very big and very small). Text analysis can enable us to consider a million books across a hundred-dimensional space, revealing aspects of our records that are not obvious to human readers whether those aspects are imperceptibly small, diffused across centuries, or simply within records never read. What does that mean in practice though?

## More Evidence for Research

The short answer is more evidence (and more kinds of evidence) for interrogating humanities problems. Dan Cohen, asks, 'how much evidence is enough?':

> Many humanities scholars have been satisfied, perhaps unconsciously, with the use of a limited number of cases or examples to prove a thesis. Shouldn't we ask, like the Victorians, what can we do to be most certain about a theory or interpretation? If we use intuition based on close reading, for instance, is that enough?
>
> Should we be worrying that our scholarship might be anecdotally correct but comprehensively wrong? Is 1 or 10 or 100 or 1000 books an adequate sample to know the Victorians? What might we do with all of Victorian literature—not a sample, or a few canonical texts, as in Houghton's work, but all of it.

To operate as a researcher in the 21st century is to be confronted with the challenges and opportunities of data—at once both being overwhelmed by too much and yet not nearly enough of *the right kind*.

As Miriam Posner has pointed out,

> ...we’re not generally creating data through experimentation or observation — more often than not, we’re mining data from historical documents. You name it, we’ve tried to mine it, from whaling logs to menus to telephone directories. This means that we tend to want different tools than scientists, and also that we have some interesting data-wrangling problems. More often than not, the categories that our historical sources used to divide up our data are not the same ones we’re interested in analyzing. So we often have to do some very creative transformations and interpretation...

Increasingly, humanities research methods rely on an ability to discover, retrieve, manipulate, and interpret textual data at scale. Humanists cannot afford to ignore computational methods since the human record is now data. Future humanists will not be able to study our digital present without becoming adept at reading and manipulating the burgeoning data of our historical record. The stakes are high for librarians, particularly for cultivating collections as data:

> Not all of the data we create or purchase for Library collections comes in neat multi-gigabyte packages of ordered files: We recently discovered that datasets we had purchased as part of a database licensing negotiation were more shelf ready than machine ready: They currently exist as stacks of hard drives, discs, and other bewildering formats sitting on a book cart. How do we provide access to these data collections?

Librarians increasingly find themselves trying to sort through collections in order to transform them into useful textual data. At the same time, they increasingly play significant educational support roles for students and researchers who recognize the value of digital records but lack the skills to unlock their potential.

For many scholars, text analysis sounds *potentially* powerful and useful, but the reality remains that learning text analysis is not a trivial task. Most learners are forced to learn on their own since there are few college courses in this work outside of data science courses. That means most learners lack access to the proper learning resources and struggle to find community support when things get difficult.

The good news is that text analysis, like any skill, can be learned to a greater or lesser degree. For historians to study the early modern period, it is helpful to have a command of Latin. Still, there are plenty of successful early modern scholars that never learn the language (or learn enough to navigate the resources significant to their research).

Depending on your research question, *you may not need to learn much coding* to do text analysis. The problem for many scholars is the possible applications for text analysis are not clear, so they are not in a good position to decide what to learn (and how much). At the same time, the sophistication needed for doing text analysis is a moving target. Topic modeling was once a very complicated task, requiring an understanding of the command line. Today, it can be accomplished in minutes using just a mouse.

The answer to "should I learn text analysis?" is ultimately an individual choice that each scholar must make for themself. Finding out your answer is not hard *if you know what tools and methods exist and how they may (or may not) enrich your research*. Only when you understand the opportunities (and associated time-cost of learning each method) can you decide if learning text analysis is likely to benefit your research and advance your career. Let's do that now.

## What text analysis methods should a digital humanist learn?

This introduction explains the various kinds of text analysis for a humanities audience. 
* What are they?
* Why would you use them?
* How difficult are they to learn?
  
The methods presented here are among the most well-known but certainly not exhaustive. Afterward, you'll be better-prepared to decide how much or how little text analysis may be useful for your research. As you read about these methods, it will be helpful to keep in mind the current, intractable problems that face your field. Could you use one of these methods to address them? There are **five main questions** that text analysis can help answer:
1. What are these texts about?
2. How are these texts connected?
3. What emotions (or affects) are found within these texts?
4. What names are used in these texts?
5. Which of these texts are most similar?

## 1. What are these texts about?
* **Word Frequency** (Beginner)<br />Counting the frequency of a word in any given text. This includes Bag of Words and TF-IDF. Example: "Which of these texts focus on women?"
* **Collocation** (Beginner)<br />Examining where words occur close to one another. Example: "Where are women mentioned in relation to home ownership?"
* **Topic Analysis (or Topic Modeling)** (Intermediate)<br />Discovering the topics within a group of texts. Example: "What are the most frequent topics discussed in this newspaper?"
TF/IDF (Intermediate)Finding the significant words within a text. Example: "What language is most significant within 1970s political speech?"

## 2. How are these texts connected?
* **Concordance** (Beginner)<br />Where is this word or phrase used in these documents? Example: "Which journal articles mention Maya Angelou's phrase, 'If you're for the right thing, then you do it without thinking.'"
* **Network Analysis** (Advanced)<br />How are the authors of these texts connected? Example: "What local communities formed around civil rights in 1963?"

## 3. What emotions (or affects) are found within these texts?
* **Sentiment Analysis** (Intermediate)<br />Does the author use positive or negative language? Example: "How do presidents describe gun control?"

## 4. What names are used in these texts?
* **Named Entity Recognition** (Intermediate)<br />List every example of a kind of entity from these texts. Example: "What are all of the geographic locations mentioned by Tolstoy?"

## 5. Which of these texts are most similar?
* **Authorship Attribution** (Advanced)<br />Find the author of an anonymous document. Example: "Who wrote The Federalist Papers?"
* **Clustering** (Advanced)<br />Which texts are the most similar? Example: "Is this play closer to comedy or tragedy?"
* **Supervised Machine Learning** (Advanced)<br />Are there other texts similar to this? Example: "Are there other Jim Crow laws like these we have already identified?"
